ResourceManager: Cache paths (so each resource doesn't have to save all it's dependencies).
ResourceManager: Add option to make files temporary or permanent (whether to unload them with 0 refs).
Locator: Change name
Locator: Make "update" work with optional ticks / time intervals (e.g. for ResourceManager).
Shader: Keep values for uniforms when updating shader (in setup()).

Move standard Procedurally functions (start and update) into an interface (instead of having to write all input management in each game)
Copy include files after every build
(Finished?) Add resource manager (and integrate through Locator with LoadMesh) 
Change to pitchfork layout
Remove row/column-major option to matrix (or integrate it fully) 
Modify CMakeLists.txt to work with external libraries (SDL/glew)
